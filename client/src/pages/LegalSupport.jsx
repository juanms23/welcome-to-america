        Below are several useful legal resources for immigrants. One of the most important legal resources to utilize is 
        the Executive Office for Immigration Review's website, which allows you to check immigration court case status, find immigration courts, and access free and low-cost legal help. Additionally, the immi online interview allows you to recieve personalized results explaining immigration options, based on an anonymous survey. It also has options to make a plan if you are concerned about being detained or deported.
